      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning React, a javascript framework for building responsive user interfaces (the long game is iNZight-built-with-React, but that&amp;rsquo;s a long way off). The best way of learning something is by mini-projects, so recently that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing! So, when it was pointed out to me last week that my bus display in the University of Auckland&amp;rsquo;s Science Buildling is broken&amp;mdash;turns out it has been since January!&amp;mdash;I thought &amp;ldquo;Ooh, another mini-react-project!</description>

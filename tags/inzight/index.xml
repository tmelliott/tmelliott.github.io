      <description>Survey data has a huge importance for many research groups, but many software tools require users to understand the survey design and know how to specify it to the relevent program. iNZight is a graphical user interface for R that lets researchers quickly and efficiently visualise and explore their data. Recent changes to iNZight allow users to forget the design and focus on what matters: exploring their data.

      <description>iNZight was originally designed to teach students core data analysis skills without the need for coding. However, it is also a powerful research development tool, allowing researchers low on time, money, or both to quickly obtain simple (or advanced) statistics without having to learn to code or pay an expensive programmer/statistician to do the work for them. iNZight now handles survey designs natively (without even needing to specify the design!</description>

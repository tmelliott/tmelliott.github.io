<div class="content">
    <p>Several years ago I decided to redesign my website (mostly as a way of learning new web technologies), but what I came up with was ... rather uninspiring. Ever since reading about Hugo, I've wanted to build my website using it (including designing my own theme and templates), but between the PhD and iNZight, I seldom felt like spending my free time doing even more coding! In recent weeks, I've had a slight break from working and found the inspiration to finally get around to the website.</p>

<div class="content">
    <p>During the first Kiwi lockdown, I planted some rocket seeds. I've enjoyed several harvests, but it appears that lengthening days have triggered baby-making-mode. Suddenly my stubby rocket plants have sent a long proboscis-like stem into the sky and have started to produce little flowers.
 
 In the photos you can see the long main stem (left) shooting up to over 30 cm tall! The last week has been very rainy in Auckland (and I was a little preoccupied with my PhD defense) so I was a little surprised to see everything booming (and even blooming!</p>

<div class="content">
    <p>Predicting the arrival time of a transit vehicle involves not only knowledge of its current position and schedule adherence, but also traffic conditions along the remainder of the route. Road networks are dynamic and can quickly change from free‐flowing to highly congested, which impacts the arrival time of transit vehicles, particularly buses which often share the road with other vehicles, so reliable predictions need to account for real‐time and future traffic conditions.</p>

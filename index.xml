      <title>IDI Search App</title>

      <description>The IDI Search App allows researchers to explore what variables are available in the IDI, and provides descriptions and SQL information about each variable. The app uses Data Dictionaries from Statistics NZ to collate collection, dataset, and variable information, which is stored within a relational database. The front end is powered by NextJS, allowing us to provide an interface for users to list all variables or, more usefully, those variables, datasets, and collections that match a specific search term.</description>

      <title>Disclosure Risk Calculator</title>

      <description>Before a dataset is made public, it needs to be checked to ensure no individuals are at risk of being identified. We developed this calculator to quickly assess a dataset for disclosure risk based on a selection of variables.
There are two aspects to the calculator:
1. Overall risk This is the risk of disclosure given the currently chosen variablse and sampling fraction. The calculations here use only information about the number of unique and paired observations, and is easily performed in the browser.</description>

      <description>The utility of data resources is often limited by technical barriers to accessing and analysing the available data. In response to this need, we have developed two software tools that reduce the cost, security, and skill restrictions affecting the use of data. Both tools are developed using the R software platform.
The first software tool is ‘iNZight’—an R-based freeware package that provides a mouse-driven user interface to a wide range of R packages for analysis and graphics.</description>

      <title>Analysing Surveys with iNZight</title>

      <description>Survey data has a huge importance for many research groups, but many software tools require users to understand the survey design and know how to specify it to the relevent program. iNZight is a graphical user interface for R that lets researchers quickly and efficiently visualise and explore their data. Recent changes to iNZight allow users to forget the design and focus on what matters: exploring their data.

      <description>iNZight was originally designed to teach students core data analysis skills without the need for coding. However, it is also a powerful research development tool, allowing researchers low on time, money, or both to quickly obtain simple (or advanced) statistics without having to learn to code or pay an expensive programmer/statistician to do the work for them. iNZight now handles survey designs natively (without even needing to specify the design!</description>

      <title>Bus Display v2 with React, D3, and Mapbox</title>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning React, a javascript framework for building responsive user interfaces (the long game is iNZight-built-with-React, but that&amp;rsquo;s a long way off). The best way of learning something is by mini-projects, so recently that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing! So, when it was pointed out to me last week that my bus display in the University of Auckland&amp;rsquo;s Science Buildling is broken&amp;mdash;turns out it has been since January!&amp;mdash;I thought &amp;ldquo;Ooh, another mini-react-project!</description>

      <title>Bayesian Demography with iNZight</title>

      <description>Bayesian demography is an important technique for minority communites, and requires special methods to infer the correct results. A set of existing R packages provide a way for researchers to fit hierarchical Bayesian models to estimate birth rates, life expectancy, or forecast important values such as diabetes rates.
iNZight is a tool for exploring and analysing data, and provides a way for researchers low on time, money, and/or skill to quickly generate the necessary results with minimal effort.</description>

      <description>Several years ago I decided to redesign my website (mostly as a way of learning new web technologies), but what I came up with was … rather uninspiring. Ever since reading about Hugo, I’ve wanted to build my website using it (including designing my own theme and templates), but between the PhD and iNZight, I seldom felt like spending my free time doing even more coding! In recent weeks, I’ve had a slight break from working and found the inspiration to finally get around to the website.</description>

      <description>During the first Kiwi lockdown, I planted some rocket seeds. I’ve enjoyed several harvests, but it appears that lengthening days have triggered baby-making-mode. Suddenly my stubby rocket plants have sent a long proboscis-like stem into the sky and have started to produce little flowers.
In the photos you can see the long main stem (left) shooting up to over 30 cm tall! The last week has been very rainy in Auckland (and I was a little preoccupied with my PhD defense) so I was a little surprised to see everything booming (and even blooming!</description>

      <title>Predicting bus arrival</title>

      <description>The real-time prediction of bus arrival time has been a central focus of real-time transit information research over the past few decades. Much of this research has shown that the most important predictors of bus arrival time are travel time between and dwell time at bus stops. Despite this, available in Auckland, New Zealand, make no account of real-time traffic state information. As road networks are dynamic and congestion can change quickly, we present a generalised prediction procedure that uses buses to estimate traffic conditions, which are in turn used in the prediction of arrival times for all other buses travelling along the same roads, irrespective of the route they are servicing.</description>

      <description>Predicting the arrival time of a transit vehicle involves not only knowledge of its current position and schedule adherence, but also traffic conditions along the remainder of the route. Road networks are dynamic and can quickly change from free‐flowing to highly congested, which impacts the arrival time of transit vehicles, particularly buses which often share the road with other vehicles, so reliable predictions need to account for real‐time and future traffic conditions.</description>

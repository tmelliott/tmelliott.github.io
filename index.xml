      <description>Several years ago I decided to redesign my website (mostly as a way of learning new web technologies), but what I came up with was ... rather uninspiring. Ever since reading about Hugo, I&#39;ve wanted to build my website using it (including designing my own theme and templates), but between the PhD and iNZight, I seldom felt like spending my free time doing even more coding!</description>

      <description>During the first Kiwi lockdown, I planted some rocket seeds. I&#39;ve enjoyed several harvests, but it appears that lengthening days have triggered baby-making-mode. Suddenly my stubby rocket plants have sent a long proboscis-like stem into the sky and have started to produce little flowers.
 
 In the photos you can see the long main stem (left) shooting up to over 30 cm tall! The last week has been very rainy in Auckland (and I was a little preoccupied with my PhD defense) so I was a little surprised to see everything booming (and even blooming!</description>

      <description>My PhD defense presentation is linked below. You possibly won&#39;t understand most of it, however, since there&#39;s no recording available and most of the text needs to be accompanied by talking!</description>

&lt;p&gt;For half a decade, I explored ways of predicting bus arrival with improved reliability. I came up with a framework that uses the GTFS information to construct a &lt;em&gt;transit network&lt;/em&gt;, allowing buses to share information about traffic conditions, even between routes.&lt;/p&gt;

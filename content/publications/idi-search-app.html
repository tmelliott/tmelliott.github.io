<p>The IDI Search App allows researchers to explore what variables are available in the IDI, and provides descriptions and SQL information about each variable. The app uses <em>Data Dictionaries</em> from Statistics NZ to collate collection, dataset, and variable information, which is stored within a relational database. The front end is powered by <a href="https://nextjs.org">NextJS</a>, allowing us to provide an interface for users to list all variables or, more usefully, those variables, datasets, and collections that match a specific search term. We also periodically obtain a list of variables in the current IDI refresh, and display this information on each variableâ€™s information page so that researchers can see whether they might need to access an older refresh to get the data they are after.</p>
<p>The app can be viewed at: <a href="https://idisearch.terourou.org/?utm_medium=terourou&amp;utm_campaign=IDI%20Search%20App">idisearch.terourou.org</a></p>

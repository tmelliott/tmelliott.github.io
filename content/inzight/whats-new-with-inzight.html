<p>Nearly a year ago (and what a year it has been), I submitted by PhD thesis (finally!) and in August I started my first (real!) job as a postdoctoral research fellow with Victoria University of Wellington (based in Auckland) working with Professor Colin Simpson and Andrew Sporle on <em>health-data-related-computing-research-and-innovation</em>. A significant part of that involves making big improvements to <a href="https://inzight.nz">iNZight</a> to make it a tool researchers can use to quickly and efficiently analyse official (and other) data with limited training and resources. And one huge part of public health data is <strong>surveys</strong>.</p>
<p>Survey functionality within <strong>iNZight</strong> has been &quot;present&quot; but only superficially: graphs and summaries made use of the design information, but that was about it. In the upcoming version 4.1 release,<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> however, <strong>iNZight</strong> natively handles survey design objects and can pass them around just like any other data type, including through data transformation functions (thanks hugely to the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=srvyr">srvyr</a> package).</p>
<p>In addition, I've created a <a href="https://inzight.nz/docs/survey-specification.html"><em>survey specification format</em></a> that allows researchers who know the survey structure to provide researchers who do not with two files: one containing the data, and another describing the structure <em>and linking to the data</em>. Why this last bit? Well, open up <strong>iNZight</strong> and load the specification file and the software automagically loads the data with the design information attached! The researcher does not need to worry about correctly specifying these details, and can jump straight into creating graphs, tables of counts, and running hypothesis tests.</p>
<p>It hasn't all been about surveys, though. I've been fixing loads of bugs that I simply didn't have time for before, improving the overall user experience. Oh, and developing a prototype module for doing some really cool Bayesian demography—but you'll have to wait a bit longer for the release of that one. Last year I also stared using a fully automated release system for <strong>iNZight</strong>, and have been tweaking that periodically; at this point, it's doing a wonderful job of maintaining the package repository, Windows installer, <em>and updating the website version information</em>, which I think is pretty neat! I started writing a post about that, but then forgot about it with all the drama that went on last year—I may get around to fixing it up and publishing at some point.</p>
<p>Upcoming items of interest include a base paper for <strong>iNZight</strong> (hopefully this will be submitted in the coming weeks to the Journal of Statistical Software to join the ranks of other GUIs such as <strong>R Commander</strong> and <strong>Deducer</strong>) and a virtual talk at <a href="https://anzsc2021.com.au/">ANZSC 2021</a> about GUIs for general and population statistical analysis.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>I am excited to announce that the automated build system now also builds the development version of iNZight every night, which you can grab <a href="https://inzight.nz/install">from the Windows downloads page</a>, just look for the <strong>Nightly build</strong> link.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>

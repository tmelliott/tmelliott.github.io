For half a decade, I explored ways of predicting bus arrival with improved reliability. I came up with a framework that uses the GTFS information to construct a _transit network_, allowing buses to share information about traffic conditions, even between routes.

```{r,message=FALSE}
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
x <- data.frame(x = 10)

x %>% mutate(x = 2 * x)

x <- x$x + 2
```

I then implement a particle filter to estimate vehicle state and ultimately road speeds which are passed to the network model, a Kalman filter running in real-time estimating current traffic conditions. From there, using a particle filter, it's fairly straightforward to estimate arrival time distributions.

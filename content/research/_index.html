<p>I spent the 2010’s at the University of Auckland’s City campus figuring out what sort of career I wanted to pursue. At first, I thought biology would be good for me, but less than half way into that degree I realised that statistics—with its combination of maths, computing, and problem solving—was for me.</p>
<p>After completing a BSc in Biological Sciences and Statistics, I quickly added an Honours in Statistics to that, which consisted of a project fitting Bayesian time series models to black hole reverberation mapping data. I found the research aspect of academia to my liking, so further pursued a thesis-based Masters degree, this time fitting Bayesian models to fisheries trawl data.</p>
<p>At this point, one must decide between finding a “real job”, or diving down the rabbit hole into academia (which of course I did). The second half of the twenty-tens was devoted to a PhD investigating the prediction of bus arrival and part-time work as the lead developer of <a href="/inzight/">iNZight</a>.</p>

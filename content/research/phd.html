<p>For half a decade, I explored ways of predicting bus arrival with improved reliability. I came up with a framework that uses the GTFS information to construct a <em>transit network</em>, allowing buses to share information about traffic conditions, even between routes.</p>

<pre class="r"><code>library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
x &lt;- data.frame(x = 10)

x %&gt;% mutate(x = 2 * x)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    x
## 1 20</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- x$x + 2</code></pre>
<p>I then implement a particle filter to estimate vehicle state and ultimately road speeds which are passed to the network model, a Kalman filter running in real-time estimating current traffic conditions. From there, using a particle filter, itâ€™s fairly straightforward to estimate arrival time distributions.</p>

<p>Installing R packages on Linux is usually a big task, especially when you upgrade your version of R and need to re-install all the packages you use for a range of projects in one go. You need to compile them all from source (and remember to add the <code>Ncpus=X</code> argument to speed things up a little). And when you’re setting up a new system, it’s even worse because half of the packages fail to install because of missing system dependencies. You gotta scroll through that list and find them—one by one—and then figure out what the library is <em>probably</em> called, install it using your package manager, and then re-compile the package.</p>
<p>But no longer! I recently saw <a href="dirk.eddelbuettel.com">Dirk Eddelbeuttel</a> tweet about BSPM, a package manager for Linux R packages. Essentially, it means you can just use <code>install.packages("package")</code> to install a <strong>binary</strong> version (if available) of the package, <strong>and its system dependencies</strong>!! Of course, I had trouble getting it to work on Ubuntu, so I thought I’d just write a quick little post for anyone else who might miss the simple steps.</p>
<div id="step-1-install-r-install-everything" class="section level3">
<h3>Step 1: <del>install R</del> install everything</h3>
<p>No, not from source. From your package repository (i.e., apt on Ubuntu). But don’t do a me and forget another crucial step: you gotta add an essential reposititory first (which I had to hunt around for when directly install <code>r-base-bspm</code> didn’t work):</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:marutter/rrutter4.0    # base R (and packages)
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:c2d4u.team/c2d4u4.0+   # 4000+ R binaries from CRAN!
sudo apt-get update</code></pre>
<p>Now you can install everything in just about one go:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>sudo apt-get install r-base-bspm</code></pre>
<p>In theory, that will install the binary version of R plus all the dependencies.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-2-install-packages" class="section level3">
<h3>Step 2: install packages</h3>
<p>For me, the main reason this is a fantastic resource is that, in developing <a href="https://inzight.nz">iNZight</a>, I need to install the ‘RGtk2’ package, which has a suite of dependencies, as do many of the other packages ‘iNZight’ depends on. But now:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bspm::enable() # enable BSPM
install.packages(&#39;RGtk2&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Tada!</p>
</div>
<div id="step-3-make-it-automatic" class="section level3">
<h3>Step 3: make it automatic</h3>
<p>I just use the following <code>.Rprofile</code> in my home directory:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># ~/.Rprofile
suppressMessages(bspm::enable())</code></pre>
<p>Now every time you start R, it’ll automatically activate BSPM and everything will be installed quickly and without breaking because of missing system dependencies!</p>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>There’s probably better ways of doing all of the above, but it works for me.</p>
<p>I particularly like this setup because it also works with <code>devtools::install</code> from a local package. For example, when locally installing my development version of ‘iNZight’ (not on CRAN) for the first time,</p>
<pre class="r"><code>devtools::install(&#39;/path/to/iNZight&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>automatically grabs all the system dependencies (GTK included!) and away we go.</p>

<p>During the first Kiwi lockdown, I planted some rocket seeds. I've enjoyed several harvests, but it appears that lengthening days have triggered baby-making-mode. Suddenly my stubby rocket plants have sent a long proboscis-like stem into the sky and have started to produce little flowers.</p>

<p>In the photos you can see the long main stem (left) shooting up to over 30 cm tall! The last week has been very rainy in Auckland (and I was a little preoccupied with <a href="/hugosite/publications/phd-defense/">my PhD defense</a>) so I was a little surprised to see everything booming (and even blooming!) this morning.</p>
<p>I believe the flowers are edible, so while I wont be able to enjoy the leaves of these rocket (I do have some others in the garden, but close inspection suggests they too are preparing to bolt) I might be able to add some fancy colourations to salads and the likes.</p>

      <description>The real-time prediction of bus arrival time has been a central focus of real-time transit information research over the past few decades. Much of this research has shown that the most important predictors of bus arrival time are travel time between and dwell time at bus stops. Despite this, available in Auckland, New Zealand, make no account of real-time traffic state information. As road networks are dynamic and congestion can change quickly, we present a generalised prediction procedure that uses buses to estimate traffic conditions, which are in turn used in the prediction of arrival times for all other buses travelling along the same roads, irrespective of the route they are servicing.</description>

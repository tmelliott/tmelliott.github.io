<p>I spent the 2010’s at the University of Auckland’s City campus figuring out what sort of career I wanted to pursue. At first, I thought biology would be good for me, but less than half way into that degree I realised that statistics—with its combination of maths, computing, and problem solving—was for me.</p>
<p>After completing a BSc in Biological Sciences and Statistics, I quickly added an Honours in Statistics to that, which consisted of a project fitting Bayesian time series models to black hole reverberation mapping data. I found the research aspect of academia to my liking, so further pursued a thesis-based Masters degree, this time fitting Bayesian models to fisheries trawl data.</p>
<p>At this point, one must decide between finding a “real job”, or diving down the rabbit hole into academia (which of course I did). The second half of the twenty-tens was devoted to a PhD investigating the prediction of bus arrival and part-time work as the lead developer of <a href="/inzight/">iNZight</a>.</p>
<p>I have now begun a three-year postdoctoral research fellowship with Victoria University of Wellington, working for their School of Health to improve access to and application of social and health data in Aotearoa, New Zealand.</p>

    <p>The real-time prediction of bus arrival time has been a central focus of real-time transit information research over the past few decades. Much of this research has shown that the most important predictors of bus arrival time are travel time between and dwell time at bus stops. Despite this, available in Auckland, New Zealand, make no account of real-time traffic state information. As road networks are dynamic and congestion can change quickly, we present a generalised prediction procedure that uses buses to estimate traffic conditions, which are in turn used in the prediction of arrival times for all other buses travelling along the same roads, irrespective of the route they are servicing.</p>

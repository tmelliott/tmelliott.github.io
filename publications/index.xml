      <title>Analysing Surveys with iNZight</title>

      <description>Survey data has a huge importance for many research groups, but many software tools require users to understand the survey design and know how to specify it to the relevent program. iNZight is a graphical user interface for R that lets researchers quickly and efficiently visualise and explore their data. Recent changes to iNZight allow users to forget the design and focus on what matters: exploring their data.

      <description>iNZight was originally designed to teach students core data analysis skills without the need for coding. However, it is also a powerful research development tool, allowing researchers low on time, money, or both to quickly obtain simple (or advanced) statistics without having to learn to code or pay an expensive programmer/statistician to do the work for them. iNZight now handles survey designs natively (without even needing to specify the design!</description>

&lt;p&gt;In which I give a very basic overview of my main methods and results in a quick 15-minute presentation at the 2020 NZSA UnConference! For more details, you may consult my thesis (code and PDF available from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tmelliott/phd-thesis&#34;&gt;tmelliott/phd-thesis&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>My PhD defense presentation is linked below. You possibly won’t understand most of it, however, since there’s no recording available and most of the text needs to be accompanied by talking!</description>

      <title>Modelling the travel time of transit vehicles in real-time through a GTFS-based road network using GPS vehicle locations</title>

      <description>Predicting the arrival time of a transit vehicle involves not only knowledge of its current position and schedule adherence, but also traffic conditions along the remainder of the route. Road networks are dynamic and can quickly change from free‐flowing to highly congested, which impacts the arrival time of transit vehicles, particularly buses which often share the road with other vehicles, so reliable predictions need to account for real‐time and future traffic conditions.</description>
